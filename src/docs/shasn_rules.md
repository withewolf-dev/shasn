# SHASN Rule Extraction

## Components
- Game board, ideology cards (multiple sets), conspiracy cards, headline cards, player mats, vote bank cards, voter pegs, resources.

## Core Concepts
- Players act as politicians competing to secure zone majorities via voters.
- Ideology cards present dilemmas yielding resources and ideology alignment.
- Resources used to influence voters (vote bank cards) or buy conspiracy cards.
- Zones require >50% voters to form majority, yielding points.

## Turn Structure
1. Right-hand neighbor draws and reads an ideology card, hiding resource rewards.
2. Active player selects an answer, announces it, keeps card face-up under mat.
3. Player gains resources from the chosen answer plus passive ideologue income.
4. Enforce resource cap (max 12) by discarding excess.
5. Optional actions (any order):
   - Buy vote bank cards (1/2/3 voters) and place voters immediately into a single zone per card.
   - Form majorities (solo or coalition) when surpassing zone requirement.
   - Buy/use conspiracy cards (can hold many, play outside turns except noted).
   - Trade resources/conspiracies 1:1 or proportional trades with others.
   - Gerrymander (if eligible) moving non-majority voters between adjacent zones.
   - Trigger headline cards when placing/gerrymandering into volatile zones.
   - Form or collapse coalitions.
6. End turn by drawing/reading next ideology card for left neighbor.

## Influencing & Voters
- Three vote bank cards always face-up; replace when purchased.
- Voters from a card must be placed same turn, cannot split across zones.
- Majority voters (flipped to S side) are immune to gerrymandering (unless specific power).

## Majorities
- Achieved by placing >50% voters in a zone; flipped voters count as points.
- Extra voters beyond requirement stay blank side, no scoring.
- Unlocks zone gerrymandering capability (unless coalition majority).

## Coalitions
- Two players can share a zone majority by combining votes.
- Must trade an ideology card (of dominant ideology) with partner upon forming coalition.
- Gerrymandering disabled in coalition zones.
- Coalitions persist until withdrawal; swapped cards not returned.

## Gerrymandering
- Available per solo majority per turn; move one non-majority voter between adjacent zones or into majority zone.
- Cannot affect majority voters or volatile-zone voters.
- Key defensive/offensive mechanic.

## Resources & Trading
- Earned via ideology cards and passive ideologue powers.
- Cap of 12; discard down before acting each turn.
- Trades must be equitable ratios; unlimited trades per turn.

## Ideologues & Powers
- Four ideologues: Capitalist, Showman, Supremo, Idealist.
- Collect ideology cards to unlock powers (Level 4 at 4 cards, Level 6 at 6 cards).
- Passive bonus: every 2 cards of type yield 1 matching resource per turn.
- Powers stack and remain active while holding cards.
- Level details:
  - Capitalist L4 Open Market: swap 1 resource with reserve for any 2 each turn; L6 Land Grab: evict up to 2 voters per turn (except volatile) including majority.
  - Showman L4 Echo Chamber: +1 bonus voter per vote bank (max 3 per turn); L6 Targeted Marketing: pay 2 media + any 3 resources to convert 2 opponent voters in same zone.
  - Supremo L4 Donations: steal up to 2 resources per turn; L6 Civil Disobedience: pay 1 resource twice to discard up to 2 opponent voters.
  - Idealist L4 Blind Faith: ignore marked cost on up to 3 vote bank cards per turn; L6 Mass Mobilisation: gerrymander 2 voters per majority per turn.

## Volatile Zones & Headlines
- Black-circle spaces; placing voter triggers headline card resolved end of turn.
- Voter in volatile zone is immutable (no gerrymander/convert/evict/discard).
- Headlines mostly negative (~70%), affect owner of triggering voter.

## Conspiracy Cards
- Cost 4 or 5 resources; flexible payment.
- Offensive/support powers; can use multiple anytime except during another player's turn (except Block!/Reverse!).

## Scoring & Endgame
- Game ends when all zones have majorities; winner has most majority voters.
- If board fills completely, initiate final round after last placement; unresolved voters discarded if placements impossible.
