# SHASN Rule Extraction

Source: https://tesera.ru/images/items/1549240/SHASN_Rulebook.pdf

## Components
- Game board, ideology cards, conspiracy cards, headline cards, player mats, vote bank cards, voter pegs, resources.

## Core Concepts
- Players act as politicians competing to secure zone majorities via voters.
- Ideology cards present dilemmas yielding resources and ideology alignment.
- Resources are used to influence voters (vote bank cards) or buy conspiracy cards.
- Zones require >50% voters to form a majority, unlocking point-scoring majorities and powers.

## Turn Structure
1. Right-hand neighbor draws and reads an ideology card, hiding resource rewards.
2. Active player selects an answer, announces it, keeps the card under their mat face-up.
3. Player gains resources from the chosen answer plus passive ideologue income.
4. Enforce resource cap (max 12) by discarding excess.
5. Optional actions (any order):
   - Buy vote bank cards (1/2/3 voters) and place voters immediately into a single zone per card.
   - Form majorities (solo or coalition) when surpassing zone requirement.
   - Buy/use conspiracy cards (may hold many, play outside turns except where noted).
   - Trade resources or conspiracy cards 1:1 or proportional trades with others.
   - Gerrymander (if eligible) moving non-majority voters between adjacent zones.
   - Trigger headline cards when placing/gerrymandering into volatile zones.
   - Form or collapse coalitions.
6. End turn by drawing/reading the next ideology card for the left neighbor.

## Influencing & Voters
- Three vote bank cards always face-up; replace when purchased.
- Voters from a card must be placed the same turn, cannot split across zones.
- Majority voters (flipped to “S”) are immune to gerrymandering unless specific powers allow it.

## Majorities
- Achieved by placing >50% of zone voters; flipped voters count as points.
- Extra voters beyond requirement remain blank side, no scoring.
- Unlocks zone gerrymandering capability (unless coalition majority).

## Coalitions
- Two players can share a zone majority by combining votes.
- Must trade an ideology card (from each player’s dominant ideology) upon formation.
- Gerrymandering disabled in coalition zones.
- Coalitions persist until withdrawal; swapped cards are not returned.

## Gerrymandering
- Available per solo majority per turn; move one non-majority voter between adjacent zones or into majority zone.
- Cannot affect majority voters or volatile-zone voters.
- Baseline limit: one voter per majority per turn; Idealist L6 doubles this.

## Resources & Trading
- Earned via ideology cards and passive ideologue powers.
- Hard cap 12; discard extras immediately.
- Trades must be even exchanges (resources or conspiracy cards). Unlimited per turn.

## Ideologues & Powers
- Four ideologues: Capitalist, Showman, Supremo, Idealist.
- Passive: every 2 cards of an ideologue grants 1 matching resource per turn.
- Level 4 unlock at 4 cards, Level 6 at 6 cards; abilities stack while cards remain.
  - Capitalist L4 Open Market (swap 1 resource for any 2); L6 Land Grab (evict up to 2 voters anywhere except volatile).
  - Showman L4 Echo Chamber (+1 bonus voter per vote bank purchase, max 3 per turn); L6 Targeted Marketing (spend 5 resources to convert 2 opponent voters in zone).
  - Supremo L4 Donations (steal up to 2 resources per turn); L6 Civil Disobedience (pay 1 resource per voter, discard up to 2 opponents’ voters).
  - Idealist L4 Blind Faith (ignore marked cost on up to 3 vote bank cards per turn); L6 Mass Mobilisation (gerrymander 2 voters per majority per turn, including majority voters).

## Volatile Zones & Headlines
- Volatile slots trigger headline draws for the owner of the placed voter; effect resolves end of turn.
- Once placed, that voter cannot be moved, converted, evicted, or discarded.
- Headlines skew negative (~70%).

## Conspiracy Cards
- Cost 4 or 5 resources (any mix); may be saved or played outside turns (Block!/Reverse! exceptions).
- Unlimited hand size and plays per opportunity.

## Scoring & Endgame
- Game ends when every zone has a majority. Winner has most majority voters.
- If board fills before all majorities, trigger final round: each player gets one last turn.
- If a purchased voter group cannot be placed during endgame, discard it.
